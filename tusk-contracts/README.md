# Tusk Contracts

The **Tusk Contracts** package contains all the core interfaces and abstractions used by the Tusk Framework.

## Purpose
Ensures interoperability between components by defining clear, language-agnostic (where possible) contracts.

## Usage
Implement these interfaces in your own components to integrate with the Tusk ecosystem.
